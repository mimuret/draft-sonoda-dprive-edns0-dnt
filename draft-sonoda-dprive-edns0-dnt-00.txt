Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              November 2018


1.  Introduction

   DNS message is personal data.  Collecting it for long time can track
   user actions.  User can send a policy using Do Not Track (DNT) header
   in HTTP Protocol.  This document specifies the EDNS(0) 'DNT' option,
   which allows stub resolver a to request messages with logging policy.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The DNT Option

   The EDNS(0) [RFC6891] specifies a mechanism to include new options in
   DNS packets, contained in the RDATA of the OPT meta-RR.  This
   document specifies the 'Logging' option in order to allows stub
   resolver a to request messages with logging policy.  The 'DNT' option
   MUST occur at most once per OPT meta-RR.

   The figure below specifies the structure of the option in the RDATA
   of the OPT RR:

   0                       8                      16
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |                  OPTION-CODE                  |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |                 OPTION-LENGTH                 |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |                 DNT-DENY-POLICY-BITS          |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The OPTION-CODE for the 'DNT' option is [[TODO-IANA]].

   The OPTION-LENGTH for the 'DNT' option is the size 1 octect.

   The DNT-DENY-POLICY-BITS is policy value.

4.  Usage Considerations

   A stub resolver RECOMMENDED can select DNT policy.  OR RECOMMENDED
   set bit0 and bit0.

5.  Server Considerations

   A server RECOMMENDED respect user policy when received a message with
   'DNT' option.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an EDNS Option Code (as described in
   Section 9 of [RFC6891]) for the 'DNT' option specified in this
   document.

7.  Operational Considerations

   'DNT' option does forbid to collect messages for NOT DNS operation
   use.

8.  Normative References

              for DNS (EDNS(0))", STD 75, RFC 6891,
